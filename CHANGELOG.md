## 0.1.1 -- 2019-08-31

* Keeps the oldest day in a group so that days can propogate to further groups.
  That is, if the group is already populated, new members are deleted until the
  oldest member moves to the next group.


## 0.1.0 -- 2019-08-31

* First version. Can print days to delete or to keep. Supports only exponential intervals.
